								<p style="text-indent:50px">Hi, my name is Matthew and I am an aspiring data analyst. My pursuit of a career in this field is a recent endeavor; however, I have been interested in observing strange trends in data and striking visualizations from a young age. Whether it be puzzling results from a complex math problem, dramatic graphical representations of seemingly banal data, or statistical anomalies related to my favorite sports teams, I have always been drawn to numbers and their derived patterns and hypothetical conclusions.<br /></p>
								<p style="text-indent:50px">I am a graduate of Transylvania University in Lexington, KY, with majors in Mathematics and Spanish Language and Literature. I gravitated towards both of these specialties for their underlying similarities of logic, recognizing patterns, and problem solving. My education and technical mindset have established my predisposition to learn coding, which I understand as a marriage between language and logic. I am self-taught in SQL, Excel, and Tableau and I desire to hone those skills, as well as advance in knowledge of new skills such as Python and Power BI. I recently earned my certificate in Googleâ€™s Data Analytics course on Coursera and I look forward to taking additional courses in this field in the future. My personal aspirations for continuous learning and perpetual improvement would be valuable assets for any data analytics team.<br /></p>
								<p style="text-indent:50px">Previously, my work experience was in the field of manufacturing. For four years, I worked as a CNC Machinist in a specialty retail fixture shop, where I gained knowledge in streamlining production processes as well as technical skills such as programming machinery and understanding machine coding. More recently, I worked as a subcontractor with a small family business, where I became proficient in a wide array of remodeling skills. While these labor-intensive jobs seem unrelated to my current pursuit, the skills I acquired in them such as attention to detail, diligent planning, and efficient problem solving overlap and directly translate to the realm of data analysis. I am a former remodeler, looking to remodel his career.</p>
